# 🫀 Heart Attack Risk Analysis

This project analyzes **heart attack risk factors** using a dataset of **500,000 entries**, leveraging **logistic regression** and **Python** for data manipulation, hypothesis testing, and visualization. The goal is to identify key behavioral and medical indicators contributing to heart disease in youth and adults across America.

## 📊 Project Overview
- **Dataset:** Heart Attack in Youth vs. Adult in America (Kaggle)
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Key Tasks:** Data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, hypothesis testing, predictive modeling

## ⚙️ Features & Analysis
✔ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Trends and patterns in heart attack risk  
✔ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling  
✔ **Hypothesis Testing**: Statistical tests to validate key risk factors  
✔ **Predictive Modeling**: Logistic regression for heart attack risk classification  
✔ **Visualizations**: Heatmaps, correlation matrices, risk factor distributions
